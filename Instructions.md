I have an Nvidia Jetson nano with a raspberry pi camera module v2 connected to it.

I would like the device to render a website that streams the camera feed over HTTP.
To set up your Nvidia Jetson Nano to stream the Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2 over HTTP, you can use a combination of GStreamer and a simple web server. 

Can you produce the code and containerize it?
